## String and membrane modeling

Simulation of the motion of a string and a membrane given by hyperbolic differential equations of the second kind under certain initial and boundary conditions.  
  
Modeling of dynamic systems is carried out using the approximation of differential equations by the corresponding difference equations.  
  
Modeling was carried out in the Wolfram Mathematica app.
