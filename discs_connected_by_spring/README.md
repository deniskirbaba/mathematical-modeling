## Discs connected by spring

# Task description

The system in question has 3 rotating discs, two of which are connected by a spring. Find the functions of the rotation angles of the discs against time and visualise the process.  
  
The Lagrangian of the system, the Lagrangian-Euler formula and the difference method for solving a differential equation must be used. The task is described in more detail in the task.pdf file.
