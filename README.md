# Mathematical modeling

In this course, work was done on modeling various systems

Each folder contains a detailed description of the task, a file with solutions and the necessary resources

## Linear spaces task (interaction of two mathematical subsystems)

Finding the connectivity vector that corresponds to the deviation of the vector in full space from
nearest separable vector
